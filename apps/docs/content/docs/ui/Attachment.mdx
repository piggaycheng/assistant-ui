## Overview

The Attachment components let the user attach files and view the attachments.

<AttachmentSample />

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** These components provide the UI for attachments, but you also need to configure attachment adapters in your runtime to handle file uploads and processing. See the [Attachments Guide](/docs/guides/Attachments) for complete setup instructions.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step>

### Add `attachment`

```sh
npx shadcn@latest add "https://r.assistant-ui.com/attachment"
```

This adds a `/components/assistant-ui/attachment.tsx` file to your project, which you can adjust as needed.

### Use in your application

```tsx title="/components/assistant-ui/thread.tsx" {1-4,9-10}
import {
  ComposerAttachments,
  ComposerAddAttachment,
} from "@/components/assistant-ui/attachment";

const Composer: FC = () => {
  return (
    <ComposerPrimitive.Root className="...">
      <ComposerAttachments />
      <ComposerAddAttachment />

      <ComposerPrimitive.Input
        autoFocus
        placeholder="Write a message..."
        rows={1}
        className="..."
      />
      <ComposerAction />
    </ComposerPrimitive.Root>
  );
};
```

```tsx title="/components/assistant-ui/thread.tsx" {1,8}
import { UserMessageAttachments } from "@/components/assistant-ui/attachment";

const UserMessage: FC = () => {
  return (
    <MessagePrimitive.Root className="...">
      <UserActionBar />

      <UserMessageAttachments />

      <div className="...">
        <MessagePrimitive.Content />
      </div>

      <BranchPicker className="..." />
    </MessagePrimitive.Root>
  );
